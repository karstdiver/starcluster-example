# starcluster-example
Shell scripts and command files that demonstrate using MIT starcluster on AWS.  You will need your own credentials.

To use:<br>
Start in the home (~) directory.<br>
Follow .bashrc calling the .directory/bash_ files that set up the AWS and starcluster environment.<br>
Edit the files to include your credentials.<br>
Change to projects/starcluster.<br>
Run the starcluster-example.sh script.<br>
If everything is set up correctly the cluster should calculate pi.<br>
If it does not work try the aws- and ec2- command aliases to start troubleshooting.<br>
